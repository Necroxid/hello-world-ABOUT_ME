# hello-world
Hello World example (GitHub tutorial).

This is a Hello World example using the **GitHub tutorial**.

## About me
I'm a **Computer Science** (CS) student based in Genova at **UniGE** university, soon to be graduated I *hope*.

### What you will find here
Here I will post *simple* projects I made in my university years, both university-related and mine ones.
I'm talking about projects with **less than 5k LOCs** in total, spread among various directories and files of course.


#### Notes
I consider myself not so skilled in programming, both in theoretical CS as well as actual coding, but I hope you will find these simple programming projects useful or interesting regardless (:

**Best regards to all of you!**
